# SentimentSift: AI-Powered Review Analysis Platform

> **Codelab Proposal**  
> *Filtering Noise, Amplifying Truth.*


---

## Overview

**SentimentSift** is an AI-powered platform designed to filter emotional biases from online reviews and provide objective, fact-based insights for consumers and businesses. SentimentSift also providing a curated list of reliable food bloggers. For each trusted blogger, the platform displays a comprehensive list of all restaurants they've previously visited and reviewed, creating a reliable recommendation network that users can trust.

A restaurant owner saying that those who gave the restaurant one-star negative reviews were all saying it took too long to wait, not that the food was bad. So there is an API that can capture the reviews of this store, and then throw it into AI analysis, there should be different results.
